# Acoustic Seabed Analysis using Bellhop & arlpy

This project uses the BELLHOP underwater acoustic propagation model integrated through the arlpy library in Python to analyze and compare sound transmission characteristics over different seabed types (clay, sand, gravel, rock). It models eigenray arrivals, impulse response, ray paths, and other acoustic properties to study seabed influence on underwater communication.

## 📌 Features

* Simulates underwater acoustic propagation using BELLHOP via arlpy
* Configurable seabed parameters: density, sound speed, and absorption
* Visualizes eigenrays, computed ray paths, impulse responses, and transmission loss
* Automatically compares output for different seabed types
* Outputs data in plots and exportable datasets (CSV/Excel)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. System Requirements

* Windows/Linux/Mac with Python 3.8+
* Anaconda (recommended for easy environment management)
* Internet access to download packages

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/acoustic-seabed-analysis.git
cd acoustic-seabed-analysis
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib arlpy
```

### 3. Install BELLHOP

BELLHOP is included automatically when you use arlpy’s underwater acoustic propagation module. However, for advanced use:

* Download BELLHOP from: [https://oalib-acoustics.org/softwares/bellhop.html](https://oalib-acoustics.org/softwares/bellhop.html)
* Place the compiled BELLHOP executable (e.g., bellhop.exe or bellhop) in your system PATH
* arlpy handles the interface automatically via uwapm


## 🚀 Running the Notebook

Open Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Run bellhop.ipynb step-by-step. You can modify seabed parameters and visualize the results interactively.

## 📊 Sample Outputs

* Eigenray arrival tables (time, angle, dB)
* Transmission loss heatmaps
* Ray path plots for all seabed types
* Comparative Excel/CSV datasets

## 💡 Future Work

* Develop a GUI/web-based interface for easy simulation and visualization
* Extend to 3D modeling and real ocean bathymetry inputs
* Support for dynamic seabed profiling using field sensors
